She and her new identity - Ekaterina Farag\u00f3 - quickly distinguished themselves. Her connections among the family and many of Ionia's industrials coupled with an uncanny diligence turned her colleagues into subordinates, and her superiors into admirers. However, her successive promotions also drew the ire of other officials. In addition, rumors of Eurydice's real identity as a member of the Philanthropenos family were confirmed by a leaked protocol regarding her family's continued operation as an arms supplier.</p> <p>Eurydice was subsequently transferred to the Secretariat for State Security on the 7th July 1911. Curiously, the accompanying missive stated \"concerns about divergent loyalties\". </p> <p>It is unclear whether the reason given is genuine, seeing as Eurydice has seemingly always outperformed her peers.
