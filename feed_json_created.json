After handling tiles, cameras and Transformers <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2169000/view/506197182866522356\"><strong>previously</strong></a>, we're back in our habitat! Today we'll talk about the <strong>story</strong>. Not just any part of it! We'll put our eyes on detailed issues very, very soon. For now, let's tell a tale about two games and two engines. </p>\n<p><strong>AUTONOMY</strong>'s duality, order in <strong>ANARCHY</strong> \u2013 and <strong>TRACHI</strong>'s 12.000 lines of dialogue.</p>\n<h2>Constitution</h2>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/assets/blog/images/steam/2025/1b30bba58b5ff166449fa3b6d919df0d01719d7c.png\">\nI admit it: AUTONOMY's true scale eluded me. My general expectation was something between six and seven thousand lines. Turns out we're much closer to <strong>8.000</strong>. For comparison: ANARCHY \u2013 including InvAsion \u2013 sits at roundabout four.</p>\n<p>I'm sure you can see the implication. If our goal is to transpose AUTONOMY's words into ANARCHY, we need a solid <strong>strategy</strong>. The how and when were subject to intense speculation until around two weeks ago. Alas, one truth was always clear as day: We're <strong>not</strong> copy-pasting line-by line. </p>\n<p>The dialogue would enter ANARCHY in a single swoop. We'd parse a whole lot of <strong>JSONs</strong> and translate the data into a format fit for Unity. One process, three construction-sites: extraction, transformation, integration.</p>\n<p>Let's start at what we'd call the source of truth!</p>", "image": "https://github.com/norygami/traki/assets/images/social/blog/posts/Archive/steam/anarchy/STEAM_25-04-06.png", "date_published": "2025-04-06T00:00:00+00:00", "authors": [], "tags": null}, {"id": "https://github.com/norygami/traki/blog/2025/03/16/expectation/", "url": "https://github.com/norygami/traki/blog/2025/03/16/expectation/", "title": "ExpectAtion", "content_html": "<h1>ExpectAtion</h1>\n<h2>Hey Friends! \ud83d\udc4b</h2>\n<p>Welcome to 2025! Our first announcement of this year tackles two topics in particular.</p>\n<p>First, a <strong>SITREP</strong> on AUTONOMY+. Technical aspects are the main ingredient of this post, since we already handled the narrative dimension <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1811440/view/507321174540159233\">here</a>. Secondly, I want to introduce and discuss a <strong>paradigm</strong> with massive implications for our project.</p>\n<p>It's a technology with a good amount <strong>controversy</strong> \u2013 so I'm incredibly eager to hear what you think. First, though: Let's start with something unproblematic!</p>\n<h2>Status</h2>\n<div class=\"md-embed md-embed--16-9\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cxdU0xPErHE\"></iframe>\n</div>\n\n<p>AUTONOMY has around 120 maps, 18 characters and 9000 lines of dialogue. AUTONOMY+ will have to have as much \u2013 if not more. I knew what was coming, but I didn't have a clear-cut <strong>strategy</strong>. Just a broad guideline: Whatever I'm able to produce in the daily aftermath of writing a 250-page book on <em>verbalized attribution of causality in German environmental discourse</em> is fine by me. </p>\n<p>Considering the state of 2025 (as of Season 3, Episode 13), I think we're hungry for good news! A large part of prologue's <strong>maps</strong> are in. I just finished Nestville, including the tiles, spawns and transfers. All the maps before that (DMZ and indoor places) are also done.</p>\n<p>The next step will be to set up quests, event-specific logic and \u2013 most importantly: the <strong>dialogue</strong>. It's hard to say how many lines belong to the prologue specifically, but I got a script to extract and post-process RPGMaker data. If we can import the lines (including speaker and conversation ID), we'd save ourselves tens, if not hundreds of hours.!</p>\n<p>I'm getting hot and bothered by the sheer scale of it. Partially due to the process \u2013 but also because I'm looking forward to the result. Once we reach parity with AUTONOMY, we can <strong>optimize</strong> 1923 from a 7/10 sequence-of-events towards a narrative masterpiece.</p>", "image": "https://github.com/norygami/traki/assets/images/social/blog/posts/Archive/steam/anarchy/STEAM_25-03-16.png", "date_published": "2025-03-16T00:00:00+00:00", "authors": [], "tags": null}, {"id": "https://github.com/norygami/traki/blog/2025/02/26/proagon/", "url": "https://github.com/norygami/traki/blog/2025/02/26/proagon/", "title": "ProAgon", "content_html": "<h1>ProAgon</h1>\n<h2>Hey Friends! \ud83d\udc4b</h2>\n<p><strong>I hope you had a stellar start of the year!</strong></p>\n<p>As you recall, we made a big <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1811440/view/527581830427181968\"><strong>announcement</strong></a> in December. Here's the recap: We're porting AUTONOMY to ANARCHY! It's a big project and a major confrontation with the past.</p>\n<p>To understand what we're dealing with, we'll take several pit-stops throughout this year. Our first impression hones in on the <strong>prologue</strong>. We'll talk about the good, the bad and the quirky. At the end of it, we pose a single question:</p>\n<p><em>What do we keep, add or rearrange?</em></p>\n<h2>Method</h2>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/assets/blog/images/steam/2025/a97b1504154556808f308df2eeca7ee60963ba03.png\">\nLet's state the obvious: Good and bad are bound by perspective. Any part of AUTONOMY could be irreplaceable to someone, while someone else might find it cringe. One way to deal with that discrepancy is to forgo other people's opinion and stick with your own.</p>\n<p>It's my go-to strategy for <strong>conceptual</strong> stuff. I have a clear vision of a scene, people and happenings. If I was content on dreaming dreams by myself, this is where I'd stop. A mind full of ideas, mayhaps a tiny prototype. No builds. No TRACHI. No clout. </p>\n<p>In reality, I translate thoughts into <strong>shapes</strong> and present them to you. A lot of ideas never find a matching form \u2013 mostly due to time constraints. AUTONOMY is no exception. The things we convey within the game(s) are the peak of a tip of an iceberg. </p>\n<p>So what do we do to ameliorate that? We try to understand the plot points of AUTONOMY and how well they're represented in the game. Starting with the scene that every player saw.</p>", "image": "https://github.com/norygami/traki/assets/images/social/blog/posts/Archive/steam/autonomy/STEAM_25-02-26.png", "date_published": "2025-02-26T00:00:00+00:00", "authors": [], "tags": null}, {"id": "https://github.com/norygami/traki/blog/2024/12/31/trachi/", "url": "https://github.com/norygami/traki/blog/2024/12/31/trachi/", "title": "TRACHI++", "content_html": "<h1>TRACHI++</h1>\n<h2>Hey Friends! \ud83d\udc4b</h2>\n<p>Look!
