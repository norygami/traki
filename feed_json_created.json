If you are interested in reading previous progress reports, feel free check them out on the game's <a href=\"https://rpgmaker.net/games/11250/\">RMN profile</a>.\nThat being said, let's cover a few cornerstones in the development history of <a href=\"https://noury.itch.io/trachi\">Trachi</a></p>\n<h3>Conceptualisation</h3>\n<p>It's hard to pinpoint a proper starting point, since the idea of creating this particular fictional world is already more than ten years old, and has gone through a lot of different iterations in the meantime. I think it was 2011 when I first started conceptualizing a few places by writing descriptions, drawing maps and the first locations. Back then, the world looked a lot more different in that it was more aligned to a generic fantasy world. Naturally, works such as Lord of the rings, A Song of Ice and Fire, but also Guild Wars and The Witcher series were a big inspiration to me in that regard.\nI think I wrote between two and three hundred pages trying to carve out the key points and dynamics of the world which didn't have a name yet. In fact, I think to this day one of my biggest struggles is coming up with names that are both unique and recognisable, while also being aesthetically pleasing in regards to their logographic and phonetical form. At some point in the future, I will go more into this, since it's a topic that not only interests me privately, but as a linguist also professionally.</p>", "image": "Noneassets/images/social/blog/posts/Archive/itch.io/ITCH_21-06-23.png", "date_published": "2025-06-21T00:56:08+00:00", "authors": [], "tags": null}, {"id": null, "url": null, "title": "From Trachi to Kenwich", "content_html": "<h1>From Trachi to Kenwich</h1>\n<p><strong>Hey friends,</strong>\nI've just released the 1.1 (Kenwich) update of the prologue.
