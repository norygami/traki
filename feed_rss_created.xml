If you are interested in reading previous progress reports, feel free check them out on the game&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://rpgmaker.net/games/11250/&#34;&gt;RMN profile&lt;/a&gt;.That being said, let&#39;s cover a few cornerstones in the development history of &lt;a href=&#34;https://noury.itch.io/trachi&#34;&gt;Trachi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Conceptualisation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s hard to pinpoint a proper starting point, since the idea of creating this particular fictional world is already more than ten years old, and has gone through a lot of different iterations in the meantime. I think it was 2011 when I first started conceptualizing a few places by writing descriptions, drawing maps and the first locations. Back then, the world looked a lot more different in that it was more aligned to a generic fantasy world. Naturally, works such as Lord of the rings, A Song of Ice and Fire, but also Guild Wars and The Witcher series were a big inspiration to me in that regard.I think I wrote between two and three hundred pages trying to carve out the key points and dynamics of the world which didn&#39;t have a name yet. In fact, I think to this day one of my biggest struggles is coming up with names that are both unique and recognisable, while also being aesthetically pleasing in regards to their logographic and phonetical form. At some point in the future, I will go more into this, since it&#39;s a topic that not only interests me privately, but as a linguist also professionally.&lt;/p&gt;</description> <pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 00:56:08 +0000</pubDate> <enclosure url="Noneassets/images/social/blog/posts/Archive/itch.io/ITCH_21-06-23.png" type="image/png" length="28191" /> </item> <item> <title>From Trachi to Kenwich</title> <description>&lt;h1&gt;From Trachi to Kenwich&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hey friends,&lt;/strong&gt;I&#39;ve just released the 1.1 (Kenwich) update of the prologue.

And so I shall.Keep in mind I&#39;m not good at deciding what&#39;s a spoiler and what&#39;s not. So I will just flag the lot of it as such.In other words: &lt;strong&gt;SPOILERS&lt;/strong&gt; abound&lt;/p&gt;</description> <pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 00:56:08 +0000</pubDate> <enclosure url="Noneassets/images/social/blog/posts/Archive/itch.io/ITCH_21-06-28.png" type="image/png" length="26882" /> </item> <item> <title>Metamorphosis</title> <description>&lt;h1&gt;Metamorphosis&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Howdy,goodbyes are often the hardest things.Two days ago, I was looking for ways to generate more characters, and stumbled upon the &lt;a href=&#34;https://visustella.itch.io/stella-character-generator&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;character generator&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Stella.Now, I wasn&#39;t originally planning on redoing the characters at this specific point. But seeing the results and comparing them with ones from the built in generator kinda left me no choice.The main characters mostly done now. I&#39;ll keep tinkering with them until I&#39;m fully satisfied and then move on to the tertiary characters.&lt;/p&gt;</description> <pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 00:56:08 +0000</pubDate> <enclosure url="Noneassets/images/social/blog/posts/Archive/itch.io/ITCH_21-07-01.png" type="image/png" length="29112" /> </item> <item> <title>Trojan Boy</title> <description>&lt;h1&gt;Trojan Boy&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ganymede&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzY0MDc5MzMucG5n/original/Tugj1c.png&#34;&gt;Born on the 3rd May 1903 in Waldnitz.Recruited into the &lt;strong&gt;Comissariat for External Affairs (CoExA) &lt;/strong&gt;in 1919.Integrated into the &lt;strong&gt;Ionian Intelligence Service (IIS)&lt;/strong&gt; in 1922.&lt;/p&gt;</description> <pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 00:56:08 +0000</pubDate> <enclosure url="Noneassets/images/social/blog/posts/Archive/itch.io/ITCH_21-07-02.png" type="image/png" length="25013" /> </item> <item> <title>Old and New</title> <description>&lt;h1&gt;Old and New&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey lads,I&#39;ve spent the last one and a half weeks primarily on remaking all the existing characters in a new generator.The face images for the three main characters are now finally implemented. The other characters in Act 1 have their base finished as well and just need their face varieties implemented.Beyond that, there&#39;s only the walking sprites left to do. This shouldn&#39;t take too long however, and I still expect to meet the end of July deadline.&lt;strong&gt;Now, as for the remake of the characters:&lt;/strong&gt;Much of the effort went into trying to keep the general features behind the characters intact. However, there are some cases where this either proved impossible, or the new remade characters are much closer to how I envisaged them in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;</description> <pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 00:56:08 +0000</pubDate> <enclosure url="Noneassets/images/social/blog/posts/Archive/itch.io/ITCH_21-07-04.png" type="image/png" length="27862" /> </item> <item> <title>Teaser &amp;amp; Status</title> <description>&lt;h1&gt;Teaser &amp;amp; Status&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey Friendos,as you might have seen, I&#39;ve released a first &lt;strong&gt;Teaser for Act 1&lt;/strong&gt;, which I&#39;d like to let speak for itself:&amp;lt;div class=&#34;embe...&lt;/p&gt;</description> <pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 00:56:08 +0000</pubDate> <enclosure url="Noneassets/images/social/blog/posts/Archive/itch.io/ITCH_21-07-10.png" type="image/png" length="28192" /> </item> <item> <title>Release date</title> <description>&lt;h1&gt;Release date&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Hey again,work on Act 1 is coming along nicely. All necessary characters have been ported and implemented successfully. And while some of them might have gotten a bit younger in their appearance, it does feel like they&#39;ve all grown up a little.Concerning &lt;/em&gt;*maps&lt;/strong&gt;, all but two outdoor areas of Act 1 are ready for release. In other words, they feature:- a certain level of detail- a contribution to the narrative- fitting audio backdrop- NPCs, including dialogue&lt;/p&gt;</description> <pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 00:56:08 +0000</pubDate> <enclosure url="Noneassets/images/social/blog/posts/Archive/itch.io/ITCH_21-07-18.png" type="image/png" length="24751" /> </item> <item> <title>Premortem</title> <description>&lt;h1&gt;Premortem&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey  fellas,it&#39;s Saturday the 24th July.&lt;strong&gt; One week from now, Trachi 1.2 will be released.&lt;/strong&gt;Since this will probably the biggest update the game has ever received, I want to use this opportunity to take a look  at some of the roadblocks and tough decisions I&#39;ve had to face during the course of development.I also had a few in-depth talks with some of the testers, recently. On one hand, I received a lot of compliments and encouragements. And while I&#39;m thankful for that, I here want to focus on a the parts of the game that they rightfully pointed out as being flawed.&lt;strong&gt;For this reason, I will not only cover game specific stuff, but also talk about general approaches to game design&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;and project management&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An emphasis will be put on &lt;strong&gt;heuristic decision making &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;path dependencies&lt;/strong&gt;. To illustrate my considerations, I will showcase examples from project T during various stages of development.That being said, let&#39;s start of with a comparison.&lt;/p&gt;</description> <pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 00:56:08 +0000</pubDate> <enclosure url="Noneassets/images/social/blog/posts/Archive/itch.io/ITCH_21-07-24.png" type="image/png" length="22642" /> </item> <item> <title>1.2 (InfiltrAtion)</title> <description>&lt;h1&gt;1.2 (InfiltrAtion)&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ladies and Gentlemen. Friends. &lt;strong&gt;ComrAdes.&lt;/strong&gt;Time&#39;s up.**And so is the next chapter of Trachi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After almost a thousand hours of development... &lt;/strong&gt;I have a little gift for you.**Please refer to the download section at your earliest convenience.You will find a file, there.Go ahead.&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzY2MzQ1MjIucG5n/original/CHNABZ.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description> <pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 00:56:08 +0000</pubDate> <enclosure url="Noneassets/images/social/blog/posts/Archive/itch.io/ITCH_21-07-31.png" type="image/png" length="28000" /> </item> <item> <title>A look ahead</title> <description>&lt;h1&gt;A look ahead&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Howdy,&lt;/strong&gt;first things first:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1.2 post-release&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the release of 1.2, I received some immediate feedback. Apparently, a few plugins were causing trouble.Thankfully, I was able to fix the issue and push out a fixed version (1.2a), a few hours after that.Since then, I&#39;ve fixed a wider range of issues and also fine-tuned specific segments of the game. The product of that is &lt;strong&gt;1.2b,&lt;/strong&gt; which I uploaded a few hours ago. Included are a few &lt;strong&gt;QOL changes&lt;/strong&gt;, as well as a bunch of &lt;strong&gt;cosmetic adjustments&lt;/strong&gt;.With that out of the way, I&#39;ll be on vacation starting tomorrow until Tuesday. After working on TRACHI ten to sixteen hours every day for the last three months, I&#39;m a bit anxious to let go of it for a couple days. On the other hand, I&#39;m also very excited to rest a bit and return refreshed and with a new perspective.But before that, I want to give you a quick rundown on some of the features coming with &lt;strong&gt;TRACHI 1.3&lt;/strong&gt;.Right now, I&#39;ve set my eyes to focus on three main areas:&lt;strong&gt;Visuals, gameplay and narrative.&lt;/strong&gt;I&#39;ll cover each of these areas in separate devlogs over the coming weeks. For now though, a few pointers to the big chances coming in 1.3:&lt;/p&gt;</description> <pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 00:56:08 +0000</pubDate> <enclosure url="Noneassets/images/social/blog/posts/Archive/itch.io/ITCH_21-08-05.png" type="image/png" length="26016" /> </item> <item> <title>Towards 1.3</title> <description>&lt;h1&gt;Towards 1.3&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hey friends,&lt;/strong&gt;it&#39;s been a while (two weeks, in fact)!Sorry I skipped last week&#39;s devlog, but I wanted to get some other stuff out of the wa...&lt;/p&gt;</description> <pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 00:56:08 +0000</pubDate> <enclosure url="Noneassets/images/social/blog/posts/Archive/itch.io/ITCH_21-08-20.png" type="image/png" length="27840" /> </item> <item> <title>Deucalion &amp;amp; beyond</title> <description>&lt;h1&gt;Deucalion &amp;amp; beyond&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Announcements&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hey friends,&lt;/strong&gt; I have a bunch of announcements, so please bear with me!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, the &lt;strong&gt;teaser for Act 2&lt;/strong&gt; has just been released:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/6lUGRKel4e4&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;281&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/6lUGRKel4e4&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; As always, I tried not give too much away and I encourage everyone to check it out, **regardless if you&#39;ve ventured into the world of Trachi, or not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will likely not be a second teaser for 1.3&lt;strong&gt;, since I want to focus on creating &lt;/strong&gt;a proper cinematic trailer&lt;strong&gt;, instead. I&#39;m still playing with ideas for that, but it will definitely feature a &lt;/strong&gt;musical backdrop&lt;strong&gt;, flanked by &lt;/strong&gt;various scenes from Act 2**. And maybe, if it turns out to be good enough, it might also include the recital of a little poem I wrote for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any case, the trailer is scheduled to be unveiled on &lt;strong&gt;September 23rd&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</description> <pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 00:56:08 +0000</pubDate> <enclosure url="Noneassets/images/social/blog/posts/Archive/itch.io/ITCH_21-08-31.png" type="image/png" length="35108" /> </item> <item> <title>State of the city</title> <description>&lt;h1&gt;State of the city&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hey Folks!&lt;/strong&gt;This will be a longer entry, so I&#39;ll get straight to the point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, I want to thank my dear friend &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twitch.tv/jayseeffaye&#34;&gt;jayseeffaye&lt;/a&gt; for featuring Trachi with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1139549555&#34;&gt;full play-through&lt;/a&gt; on his stream.I highly encourage you to check it out. I had a blast watching it, and I&#39;m sure you will, too!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Updated Release Date&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On another note, there&#39;s a piece of (maybe) bad news I&#39;ll have to break to you.Unfortunately, I&#39;ll be away for the 30th, since I have to attend a wedding (not my own ofc, you silly boys~).Don&#39;t worry, though!I won&#39;t be all boring and delay the release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, I&#39;ll just pull it one day forward.For that matter, **the new release date will be the 29th September, 2021!**As mentioned in the last devlog, I&#39;m planning a few things to celebrate the release. It&#39;s not set in stone, yet, but I&#39;m planning to involve several people who have accompanied me part of the ways. And I&#39;m very keen on putting them into the spotlight as a way of showing my unending gratitude to them.In any case, though.&lt;/p&gt;</description> <pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 00:56:08 +0000</pubDate> <enclosure url="Noneassets/images/social/blog/posts/Archive/itch.io/ITCH_21-09-07.png" type="image/png" length="28582" /> </item> <item> <title>Cumparsita (aka: what&#39;s new?)</title> <description>&lt;h1&gt;Cumparsita (aka: what&#39;s new?)&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Howdy!&lt;/strong&gt;Guess who&#39;s on time.Not me, for sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But anyways, I&#39;ll get right to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before that, though, I want to do a quick shout out to a &lt;strong&gt;very wholesome and amazing streamer&lt;/strong&gt;:The great and amazing &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twitch.tv/yingy9&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;yingy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; did a play through of the prologue and parts of Act 1 on her stream, today!So please, if Trachi by itself is too boring for you (which I can emphasise with), please make sure to check out the corresponding vod &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1150125795&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that being said, let&#39;s look at where we @!&lt;/p&gt;</description> <pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 00:56:08 +0000</pubDate> <enclosure url="Noneassets/images/social/blog/posts/Archive/itch.io/ITCH_21-09-16.png" type="image/png" length="39151" /> </item> <item> <title>Actual Saturday Update</title> <description>&lt;h1&gt;Actual Saturday Update&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hey,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I kinda wrote this devlog yesterday already, but forgot to save the draft (keklmao).So I&#39;ll try to be extra concise here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words: take notes, Square Enix.This is how you announce stuff.JK JK, I loved the job trailer, hehe!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyways, let&#39;s start of by looking at what&#39;s going to happen, &lt;strong&gt;next weekend&lt;/strong&gt;.There will likely not be a devlog there, since I&#39;ll do &lt;strong&gt;the preview of 1.3 sometime around next week&lt;/strong&gt;.The reason for that is we have something a lot more awesome planned, instead.&lt;/p&gt;</description> <pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 00:56:08 +0000</pubDate> <enclosure url="Noneassets/images/social/blog/posts/Archive/itch.io/ITCH_21-09-18.png" type="image/png" length="34382" /> </item> <item> <title>STREAM SCHEDULE UPDATE (yes, all caps for this one)</title> <description>&lt;h1&gt;STREAM SCHEDULE UPDATE (yes, all caps for this one)&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey friends,this will be a super short one.And I apologize if I&#39;m spamming your feed.In any case, there&#39;s a slight adjustment to the&lt;strong&gt;

three sessions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; in tota&lt;/strong&gt;l.This means that we&#39;ll have &lt;strong&gt;one day per Act&lt;/strong&gt; and can fully focus on that.In other words, it&#39;s gonna be a&lt;strong&gt; full weekend of TRACHI&lt;/strong&gt; for you guys to enjoy.So let&#39;s have another look at what&#39;s going to happen and when.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;FINALIZED SCHEDULE&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday, 24th September: ProAgon&lt;/strong&gt;18:00-21:00 CEST&lt;strong&gt;Saturday, 25th September: InfiltrAtion&lt;/strong&gt;
