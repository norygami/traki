I think it was 2011 when I first started conceptualizing a few places by writing descriptions, drawing maps and the first locations. Back then, the world looked a lot more different in that it was more aligned to a generic fantasy world. Naturally, works such as Lord of the rings, A Song of Ice and Fire, but also Guild Wars and The Witcher series were a big inspiration to me in that regard.\nI think I wrote between two and three hundred pages trying to carve out the key points and dynamics of the world which didn't have a name yet. In fact, I think to this day one of my biggest struggles is coming up with names that are both unique and recognisable, while also being aesthetically pleasing in regards to their logographic and phonetical form. At some point in the future, I will go more into this, since it's a topic that not only interests me privately, but as a linguist also professionally.</p>", "image": "Noneassets/images/social/blog/posts/Archive/itch.io/ITCH_21-06-23.png", "date_modified": "2025-06-21T04:01:13+00:00", "authors": [], "tags": null}, {"id": null, "url": null, "title": "Onwards", "content_html": "<h1>Onwards</h1>\n<p><strong>Greetings,</strong>\nin the last prog report, I promised to put out more infos on Act 1.
