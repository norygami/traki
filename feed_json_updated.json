I reached out to several artists (like <a href=\"https://x.com/zuhzudi\"><strong>zuddi</strong></a>) and commissioned pieces left and right.

Secondly, I want to introduce and discuss a <strong>paradigm</strong> with massive implications for our project.</p>\n<p>It's a technology with a good amount <strong>controversy</strong> \u2013 so I'm incredibly eager to hear what you think.

AUTONOMY+ will have to have as much \u2013 if not more. I knew what was coming, but I didn't have a clear-cut <strong>strategy</strong>. Just a broad guideline: Whatever I'm able to produce in the daily aftermath of writing a 250-page book on <em>verbalized attribution of causality in German environmental discourse</em> is fine by me. </p>", "image": "https://norygami.github.io/traki/assets/images/social/blog/posts/Archive/steam/anarchy/STEAM_25-03-16.png", "date_modified": "2025-06-22T09:25:29+00:00", "authors": [], "tags": null}, {"id": "https://norygami.github.io/traki/blog/2025/04/06/words/", "url": "https://norygami.github.io/traki/blog/2025/04/06/words/", "title": "Words", "content_html": "<h1>Words</h1>\n<h2>Hi Friends! \ud83d\udc4b</h2>\n<p>I know It's early \u2013 but we just passed a major tipping-point. </p>\n<p>In one sentence: AUTONOMY to ANARCHY.

Here's the recap: We're porting AUTONOMY to ANARCHY! It's a big project and a major confrontation with the past.</p>\n<p>To understand what we're dealing with, we'll take several pit-stops throughout this year. Our first impression hones in on the <strong>prologue</strong>. We'll talk about the good, the bad and the quirky. At the end of it, we pose a single question:</p>\n<p><em>What do we keep, add or rearrange?</em></p>\n<h2>Method</h2>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"../../../../../assets/blog/images/steam/2025/a97b1504154556808f308df2eeca7ee60963ba03.png\">\nLet's state the obvious: Good and bad are bound by perspective. Any part of AUTONOMY could be irreplaceable to someone, while someone else might find it cringe. One way to deal with that discrepancy is to forgo other people's opinion and stick with your own.</p>\n<p>It's my go-to strategy for <strong>conceptual</strong> stuff. I have a clear vision of a scene, people and happenings. If I was content on dreaming dreams by myself, this is where I'd stop. A mind full of ideas, mayhaps a tiny prototype. No builds. No TRACHI. No clout. </p>", "image": "https://norygami.github.io/traki/assets/images/social/blog/posts/Archive/steam/autonomy/STEAM_25-02-26.png", "date_modified": "2025-06-22T09:25:29+00:00", "authors": [], "tags": null}, {"id": "https://norygami.github.io/traki/blog/2021/07/02/trojan-boy/", "url": "https://norygami.github.io/traki/blog/2021/07/02/trojan-boy/", "title": "Trojan Boy", "content_html": "<h1>Trojan Boy</h1>\n<h2>Ganymede</h2>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"../../../../assets/blog/images/itch/2021/Tugj1c.png\">\nBorn on the 3rd May 1903 in Waldnitz.\nRecruited into the <strong>Comissariat for External Affairs (CoExA) </strong>in 1919.\nIntegrated\u00a0into the <strong>Ionian Intelligence Service (IIS)</strong> in 1922.</p>", "image": "https://norygami.github.io/traki/assets/images/social/blog/posts/Archive/itch.io/ITCH_21-07-02.png", "date_modified": "2025-06-22T09:17:18+00:00", "authors": [], "tags": null}, {"id": "https://norygami.github.io/traki/blog/2021/07/04/old-and-new/", "url": "https://norygami.github.io/traki/blog/2021/07/04/old-and-new/", "title": "Old and New", "content_html": "<h1>Old and New</h1>\n<p>Hey lads,\nI've spent the last one and a half weeks primarily on remaking all the existing characters in a new generator.\nThe face images for the three\u00a0main characters are now finally implemented.
