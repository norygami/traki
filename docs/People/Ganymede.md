    **Name**: Timotej Stojanov  
    **Born:** 3rd May 1903 || Scupi   

    **Career**:   
    [CoExA][] [1918]  
    [IIS][] [1921]  

Unfortunately, not much of his MO is known to us, as the majority of [CoExA][]'s archives were irretrievably lost in 1922, shortly before the IIS was formed. 
In addition, both undersecretary Ionis Fairclough and Ganymede himself have proven exceptionally reluctant to relay a full record of his assignments, so far.
What we do know, is that Ganymede spent considerable time working as an operative within Amryn. It is likely that he was also at least partially involved in the [assassination of General Wilkert Forten][] in 1920.

## Evaluation
From what the undersecretary relayed to us, Ganymede's specialities lie in the area of active deception and reconnaissance, which proved true in one instance, at the very least.

During an operation in the city-state of Dusa a few months ago, several of our assets were in the process of being compromised by the local authorities.
This would have certainly led to severe damage on our side, as we still haven't found the source of the leak to this day.
Regardless, Ganymede was able to successfully divert the authorities' attention to the Amrynian network by posing as one of their agents. With an expressed intent to seek asylum, he sold out several of their key assets and thus provided us with the time needed to restructure our own network in Dusa.

    Although we don't have most of the details, it is likely that Ganymede will apply a similar approach to the present operation. Due to his background, he can draw extensively from his connections among former members of CoExA, which still constitute the overwhelming majority of our network in Trachi.
