## Early Life
Atlas' life before [EnKAD][] is a question mark. Both of his parents were allegedly killed by Republicans during the 2nd Enlightement. Being left an orphan, Atlas was raised by his aunt, until he disappeared in 1908.

## Bosporoi
By the time he resurfaced in 1910, Atlas established himself as a Stratigos of the Bospori Syndicate. Rumours say that he engaged in several criminal activities – from racketeering to gambling to the dissemination of illegal substances such as opium and heroin. Although the Bospori were known to engage in human trafficking and forced prostitution, it is unclear whether Atlas played a role in the organization of these crimes. In contrast, there is substantial evidence linking him to the Kerameikos Central Station Robbery, for which he was arrested by the Metropolitan Police on July 7th, 1913.

While Atlas was being held for questioning, a senior officer from EnKAD – [Crius][] – happened to inspect the local prefecture. Crius took a personal interest in Atlas and took it upon himself to conduct the interrogation. According to an anonymous member of the prefecture's medical staff, 'Crius opened negotiations by shooting Atlas in the leg'. However, Atlas supposedly refused to share the names of his co-associates.

## EnKAD
Crius was seemingly impressed with Atlas' resilience and offered him amnesty if Atlas were willing to become an informant for EnKAD. Contrary to most of EnKADs extended personnel, Atlas' civil name was registered into Cipher and henceforth treated as a grade-1 state-secret. Atlas henceforth operated under his Mononym, granting him grade-2 security clearance and access to the EnKAD compounds 3 to 12. More importantly, Crius regarded Atlas' as one of his protégé and supposedly even introduced him to his wife Cecilia and daughter [Dorothy][]. 

## Kenovice
The mentor-mentee relationship between Atlas and Crius continued until early 1915. When the Dichotomy Act discharged Crius and large parts of EnKAD's upper-echelon after the assassination of Chairman Antoni, Atlas remained with the government-aligned faction – becoming a civil servant of the Secretariat for State Security. His first assignment saw dispatched him to Kenovice and assist the Ionian Army's pacification of the city. According to sources close to StateStec, Atlas supervised the abduction of Crius' wife and daughter and personally ended Crius' life.

## Calpoli
In the year 1919, Atlas loyalties were put to the test once more. His contact in the irregular Military Intelligence Platoon Periphas – Corporal [Lorna Farago][], attempted desertion by crossing into Serbia. Although the exact sequence of events remain confidential, excerpts of Atlas' statement were published in StateSec's 1920 report. According to Atlas, Farago had been under active surveillance since 1915. In accordance with §83b of the natural secrets act, her ties to a senior member of Ionian intelligence made Corporal Farago – in Atlas' words – a *likely vector of subversion*. While his romantic relationship with Farago hoped to detect recruitment attempts by foreign actors, his primary goal was to provoke such an attempt. 

When Farago and Atlas were about to pass the Ionian checkpoint near Calpoli, they were picked up by members of the IAF. Atlas' was quickly released at the behest of EnKAD, which called for an immediate interdepartmental inquiry. As the chief witness, Atlas lambasted the intrusion of border officials: 

!!! quote "Case Calpoli: Minutes"

    *The intervention by the hands of the IAF dismantled a unique opportunity to expose high-ranking members of [REDACTED]'s intelligence. Over the last six years, Ionia has lost tens – if not hundreds – of state officials to illegal emigration.* 

    *Although the IAF's enthusiasm is to be commended, this incident further underlines the redundancies imposed by disconcerted intelligence operations. Should there not be a concious effort to consolidate – or at the very least coordinate – intradepartmental efforts, Ionia's intelligence will remain its own worst enemy.*

Shortly after the publication of the report, Ionia's central committee passed a memorandum to formulate an integrated intelligence strategy. The most prominent expression of this centralization emerged in 1921, when the [Commissariat for External Affairs][] (CoExA) was transferred from the Secretariat of External Affairs to the Secretariat for State Security. Although EnKAD wasn't formally affected by the reorganization, it henceforth operates under the umbrella of the [Ionian Intelligence Service][].
