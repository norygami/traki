## Early Life
Atlas' life before [EnKAD][] is a question mark. Both of his parents were allegedly killed by Republicans during the [2nd Enlightement][]. Being left an orphan, Atlas was raised by his aunt, until he disappeared in 1908.

## Bosporoi
By the time he resurfaced in 1910, Atlas established himself as a Stratigos of the [Bospori Syndicate][]. Rumours say that he engaged in several criminal activities – from racketeering to gambling to the dissemination of illegal substances such as opium and heroin. Although the Bospori were known to engage in human trafficking and forced prostitution, it is unclear whether Atlas played a role in the organization of these crimes. In contrast, there is substantial evidence linking him to the Kerameikos Central Station Robbery, for which he was arrested by the Metropolitan Police on July 7th, 1913.

While Atlas was being held for questioning, a senior officer from EnKAD – [Crius][] – happened to inspect the local prefecture. Crius took a personal interest in Atlas and took it upon himself to conduct the interrogation. According to an anonymous member of the prefecture's medical staff, 'Crius opened negotiations by shooting Atlas in the leg'. However, Atlas supposedly refused to share the names of his co-associates.

## EnKAD
Crius was seemingly impressed with Atlas' resilience and offered him amnesty if Atlas were willing to become an informant for EnKAD. Contrary to most of EnKADs extended personnel, Atlas' civil name was registered into Cipher and henceforth treated as a grade-1 state-secret. Atlas henceforth operated under his Mononym, granting him grade-2 security clearance and access to the EnKAD compounds 3 to 12. More importantly, Crius regarded Atlas' as one of his mentees and supposedly even introduced him to his wife Cecilia and daughter [Dorothy][]. 

## Kenovice
The relationship between Atlas and Crius continued until early 1915, when Crius was discharged from EnKAD due to his alleged involvement in the assassination of Pjotr Antoni. Atlas remained a member of EnKAD and consequentially became a civil servant of the Secretariat for State Security. His first assignment under his new handler – [Eurydice][] – dispatched him to Kenovice in order to assist the Ionian Army in the pacification of the city and formally end the Dichotomy by purging EnKAD's Hippocratic branch. Atlas was not only involved in the kidnapping of Crius' wife and daughter, but also personally ended Crius' life.

## Calpoli
In the year 1919, Atlas loyalties were put to the test once more. His contact in the irregular Military Intelligence Platoon Periphas – Corporal [Lorna Farago][], attempted desertion by crossing into Serbia through the checkpoint near Calpoli. Although the exact sequence of events remain confidential to this day, fragments of Atlas' statements were published as part of the StateSec's annual report. According to Atlas, he had been investigating Farago since 1915, primarily due to her familial ties with a senior member of Ionia's intelligence organizations. Corporal Farago was – in Atlas' words – a *likely vector of foreign subversion* and put under surveillance in accordance with §83a of the Ionian Constitution. 

When Farago was about to cross the border, both herself and Atlas were picked up by members of the IAF and held for questioning. Atlas' was cleared of any charges, but lamented the intrusion of border officials in his statement given to an internal EnKAD inquiry: 

!!! quote "Case Calpoli: Minutes"

    *"If it weren't for the intervention by the hands of the IAF, Corporal Farago's desertion might've produced a unique opportunity to lure out high-ranking members of* [REDACTED]'s *intelligence network. Over the last six years, Ionia has lost tens – if not hundreds – of state officials to illegal emigration.* 

    *Although the IAF is to be commended for their efforts, this incident is further proof that all intelligence operations – including those conducted by the Secretariat for Foreign Affairs and the Secretariat for Defense – should be coordinated with the Secretariat for State Security."*

It's assumed that Calpoli was a major catalyst for Ionia to adapt an integrated intelligence strategy. One expression of this centralization appeared in 1921, when the [Commissariat for External Affairs][] (CoExA) was transferred from the Secretariat of External Affairs to the Secretariat for State Security. Although EnKAD itself wasn't practically affected by the reorganization, it henceforth operates under the umbrella of the [Ionian Intelligence Service][].
