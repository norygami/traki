    **Name**: Dorothy Preston  
    **Born:** 6th July 1901 || [Kenovice][]  

    **Career**:  
    [EnKAD][] [1917]

## Background
A graduate in the field of behavioral psychology, Daphne distinguished herself in her role as a field counselor during a wide range of domestic assignments.

Her most prominent achievement was the liquidation of a rogue agent and the subsequent destruction of the Neo-Hippocrats during the Hermingrad-incident in 1922. Three days after Daphne arrived, Leucippus turned himself in and presented a full account of the events, coupled with a comprehensive list of everyone he cooperated with.

Her success in Hermingrad subsequently made her a prime candidate for future high-priority assignments.

    As the Secretary pointed out, Daphne's lack of experience in foreign territory may be a caveat. 
    However, it's also the only one, as far as I can see.
    She is diligent, perceptive and equipped with a proper sense of discretion.
    Her relationship to one of her potential associates could make her somewhat unpredictable. 

    Though the secretary has ensured the commission that this will, ultimately, work in our favour.
