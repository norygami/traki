## Background
Orpheus was born into a family of low-ranking civil servants in the province of Macedonia. Shortly after his birth, his family had to flee the approaching Amrynian army during the [Thalassian War](). As an official of the state, his father received employment in the city of Byzantion, where Orpheus spent the rest of his early childhood.
