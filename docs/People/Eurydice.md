## Background
Eurydice was born as the oldest child of Mihail Philanthropenos and his wife Stellina Philanthropenos. Her father's position as the head of the [Philanthropenos][] caused Eurydice to have a turbulent childhood, dominated by the family's political standing within Helas. While the house was able to make a massive fortune before the Thalassian War through governmental contracts, the aftermath and implications of the second Suez Incident left the entire house broken and publicly condemned.

The family's favour turned during the 2nd Enlightenment, which saw the revolutionary forces emerge victorious, in large parts due to the assistance of the Philanthropenos clan and their supply of military-grade equipment.

Although the house wasn't able to regain their former reputation and subsequently stripped of all their titles by the provisional government, most members of the family were provided with a new identity and governmental positions in the newly formed Ionia.


## Seceretariat of Defense
Among this cohort, Eurydice began her career as a civil servant in the Secretariat of Defense. She and her new identity - Ekaterina Farag√≥ - quickly distinguished themselves. Her connections among the family and many of Ionia's industrials coupled with an uncanny diligence turned her colleagues into subordinates, and her superiors into admirers. However, her successive promotions also drew the ire of other officials. In addition, rumors of Eurydice's real identity as a member of the Philanthropenos family were confirmed by a leaked protocol regarding her family's continued operation as an arms supplier.

Eurydice was subsequently transferred to the Secretariat for State Security on the 7th July 1911. Curiously, the accompanying missive stated "concerns about divergent loyalties". 

It is unclear whether the reason given is genuine, seeing as Eurydice has seemingly always outperformed her peers. However, internal [Endo-Kathartic Dialect][] memos suggest that she requested the reassignment herself. The timing of her transfer also coincides with her sister [Lorna][]'s first arrest by the police.

## Endo-Kathartic Dialect
Once again, Eurydice quickly adapted to her new environment and made extensive use of governmental and non-governmental connections to great effect. During the reclamation of Kenovice, Eurydice was able to severely diminish resistance to the occupation by activating assets loyal to her family and thus create an information network to recruit collaborators all over the region.

This brought her to the attention of the Secretary private Commissar, [Hyperion][], who was at that time actively looking for prospective candidates to form Caduceus, comprised of recruits in their late teens and early twenties. Unfortunately, neither Hyperion nor Eurydice ever divulged the topics of the latter's recruitment conversation. Regardless, here, too there are pointers indicating a connection between Eurydice's curriculum vitae and her sister's frequent run-ins with the authorities.

Be that as it may, Eurydice formally became a member of EnKAD in 1912. From that point onward, she performed in exceptional capacity and is said to have been one of the building blocks in EnKAD's most critical operations.

## Kenovice
As the commanding officer in charge of rooting out the Hippocrats in 1915, she performed vital tasks in ensuring operational excellence and was instrumental in keeping losses to a minimum. However, the operation and exponentially growing work hours must've also left its mark on Eurydice, as colleagues report her being "mindlessly absent to any topic not related to work". It's unclear whether Eurydice was in fact overworked or simply looking for a new challenge. Notwithstanding that, she formally requested yet another transfer in 1919.

## CoExA
This time, her way took her to the [Commissariat for External Affairs][]. Unfortunately, we have yet to uncover the whole range of her work within that institution until it was amalgamated into the [Ionian Intelligence Service][] in May 1920. A few months later, Eurydice took part in Operation effigy and was thus dispatched to [Trachi][] along with another CoExA agent, [Orpheus][]. On the 4th June, a message stated that "everything was in order" and "the appropriate assets informed of their obligations".

## Disappearance
However, this turned out to be the last piece of correspondence on the duo's part, as both of them haven't been heard of, ever since. An investigation by one of our agents dispatched shortly afterwards also failed to derive an explanation behind their disappearance. What came to light, though, was that Orpheus had been operating as a double agent going by the name "Gregor Lorentz". It is thus assumed that Eurydice either collaborated with Orpheus, or was put out of commission by him. 

## Assessment

!!! quote 
    *Considering the present state of knowledge, we can't be sure whether Eurydice is still alive. There have been numerous reports claiming to have seen Eurydice in Trachi over the last two years. However, none of our follow-up investigations were able to find Eurydice, nor give any indication towards her state. If Eurydice indeed is still at large, we have to consider her potential impact on operation arteria, as well. From what the Secretary told me, Eurydice is "far too dangerous and persuasive for one agent alone". Especially if that agent has worked closely with Eurydice in the past, and is also said to have had a non-platonic relationship with her sister.*

    *If Eurydice reappears, we need to be prepared.*
