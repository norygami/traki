**Hey Friend! ðŸ‘‹**

Welcome to TRACHI's knowledge base! 

## TRAâ€“ what?
![SHTSI](assets/general/SHTSI_C_P_T.png){ width=200, align=right }
<span title="tra.:kÊ°i">**TRACHI**</span> is a series of [video-games](https://store.steampowered.com/franchise/TRACHI) set in a fictional 20th-century. It's a story about continental politics, espionage and subversion. A lot of people saying things â€“ <span title="more or less">some of it</span> â€“ the <span title="Whatever that means nowadays.">truth</span>.

<span title="tra.:kÊ°i">**TRAKI**</span> tries to separate <span title="fictional">fact</span> from <span title="fictional">fiction</span>. We want to gather, assess and evaluate what the TRACHIANS have been up to.

And whether they pose a threat.
