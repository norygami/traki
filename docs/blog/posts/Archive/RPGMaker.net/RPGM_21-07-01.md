# The Fury of Hermingrad
### BIO
*REDACTED* was born on the 15th November 1901 in Kenwich.
Initiated into the **Endo-Kathartic Department (EnKaD)** on the 3rd of March 1920, she was henceforth known by her assigned codename, **Daphne**.

### BACKGROUND
A graduate in the field of behavioural psychology, Daphne distinguished herself in her role as a **field counsellor** during a wide range of domestic assignments.

Her most prominent achievement was the retrieval of an agent during the **Hermingrad-Incident** in 1922.
An enforcer named Leucippus had prematurely liquidated one of his targets, and subsequently went AWOL in order to avoid admonition.

Three days after Daphne's arrival, Leucippus turned himself in and presented a full account of the events.

### OPERATION arteria 
Her success in Hermingrad subsequently caught the eye of the Secretary for Internal and External State Security, Terrence Prawnfield.

On the 6th of June 1923, Daphne was thus summoned to the offices of the newly amalgamated Ionian Intelligence Secretariat (IIS) to discuss her potential participation in operation arteria, scheduled to take place in August of the same year.
