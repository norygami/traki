# 1.3 InfestAtion
Hey,

sorry it took me a bit to post this here.
I've tried uploading the game to this site, but the file size has become too big, lol.

So the download link will now lead you to trachi.net, where the game is also hosted. Apologies for the inconvenience. I'll try to sort something out over the next few days so it can be hosted here, properly.

In any case, **1.3 (InfestAtion)** is now out. Hurray!
Narrative preview
Changelog

Anyways, last few weeks have been a roller coaster for me. So I'll come to a quick close here and let the game speak for itself.
I've worked in a lot of feedback that I got since the last release, and want to thank everyone who voiced their opinion on the game.

It's bigger and better than ever before, so please do feel free to give it a go.
In any case, I'll be back next week with another post.

Much love, as always
Nory
