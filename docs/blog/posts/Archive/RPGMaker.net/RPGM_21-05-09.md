# Back on track
Heyo,



good news: The first day is more or less finished and playable. I still need to implement a few more NPCs and adjust a few scenes, but other than that, it's mostly done. The main thread of Day two is also roughly finished. It's thus possible to play from the prologue all the way to the end of Day two. Hurray!

Next up, I'll work more on Day three. It's pretty amazing seeing the story finally come to it's conclusion and I can't wait to share it. Nevertheless, the game still needs a heap of work. Not only to be playable, but also enjoyable and well-paced. 

As mentioned before, the story will continue after the conclusion of Trachi. However it's still hard to gauge which form that's gonna take.

I've been playing with the idea of releasing information on characters and such, now that their role is already set. I'll try to do something like that, soon.

In any case, I'll be back in two weeks (hopefully).
