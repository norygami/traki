# Towards 1.3
**Hey friends,**

it's been a while!

Work on **Trachi 1.3** has progressed nicely, even though I took an entire week off and mainly focussed on back end stuff for another one.

Regarding **Act 2**: around 1/3 of the day is now finished, aka playable and up to date.

I expect to have the entire first half of the act wrapped up during the course of the next week.
At that point I'll also hopefully release the first **teaser**, along with a few screenshots showing some the new areas.

As for this week, there's not much more to tell.
Oh wait, there's one thing.

**I don't think I've announced the name of the second act, yet:**


Hope you have a good time.
See you next week!

Much love
Nory
