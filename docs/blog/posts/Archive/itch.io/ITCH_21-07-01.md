# Metamorphosis

Howdy,
goodbyes are often the hardest things.
Two days ago, I was looking for ways to generate more characters, and stumbled upon the [**character generator**](https://visustella.itch.io/stella-character-generator) by Stella.
Now, I wasn't originally planning on redoing the characters at this specific point. But seeing the results and comparing them with ones from the built in generator kinda left me no choice.
The main characters mostly done now. I'll keep tinkering with them until I'm fully satisfied and then move on to the tertiary characters.
It is very important to me keep the general idea behind the characters, as well as their prominent features, intact. There are a few limitations I'll have to work around and some of the scenes might have to be slightly adjusted. However, since I'm right in the middle of playtesting Act 1 anyway, this is as good a chance as any.
I realize that this will inevitably lead to some kind of stylistic break with the prologue. Which is why I will eventually update it with the new images, as well. However, this will definitely happen after I'm done with Act 1, at least.
In any case, I'm very much looking forward to presenting the results in the next few devlogs, and also use this opportunity to talk about some of the characters, a bit more. The first of which I'll upload in a separate post straight away.
Have a spectacular time until then.
