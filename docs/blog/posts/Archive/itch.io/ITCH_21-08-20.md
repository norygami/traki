# Towards 1.3
**Hey friends,**
it's been a while (two weeks, in fact)!
Sorry I skipped last week's devlog, but I wanted to get some other stuff out of the way before I set my mind back on the game.
Work on **1.3** has progressed nicely, even though I took an entire week off and mainly focussed on backend stuff for another one.

**Regarding Act 2****: **around **1/3 of the day** is now** finished**, aka playable and up to date.
I expect to have the entire first half of the act wrapped up during the course of the next week .
At that point I'll also hopefully release the first **teaser**, along with a few screenshots showing some the new areas.
As for this week, there's not much more to tell.
Oh wait, there's one thing.
**I don't think I've announced the name of the second act, yet:**

Hope you have a good time.
See you next week!
Much love
