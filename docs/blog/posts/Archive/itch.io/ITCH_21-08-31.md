## Announcements
**Hey friends,**Â 
I have a bunch of announcements, so please bear with me!

First of all, the **teaser for Act 2** has just been released:

 As always, I tried not give too much away and I encourage everyone to check it out, **regardless if you've ventured into the world of Trachi, or not. 
****
There will likely not be a second teaser for 1.3**, since I want to focus on creating **a proper cinematic trailer**, instead. 
I'm still playing with ideas for that, but it will definitely feature a **musical backdrop**, flanked by **various scenes from Act 2**. 
And maybe, if it turns out to be good enough, it might also include the recital of a little poem I wrote for it.
 
In any case, the trailer is scheduled to be unveiled on **September 23rd**. 
<!-- more -->

And one week after that,** 1.3 (InfestAtion) will be released**:

That's right, we have a date, you and I!
With that being said, I want to quickly touch on how I'm aiming to handle that day: 
I've been thinking of doing a **commemorative, commented playthrough of Trachi** **from start to the end of Act 2**. 
If my connection is able to handle it, I'll do a **stream on Twitch**, otherwise it will be a **video uploaded to YT**.
I'll keep you posted, show off a bit more of the city and give some pointers as to where the story is gonna go, during the next couple of weeks.****
****
Regardless, I wanna thank you for your support, dedication and attention.
Trachi is bigger than ever, and it's mostly thanks to you guys!
I couldn't do it without you!
Hope all of you lovelies have a great week!
Much much love,
 Nory
