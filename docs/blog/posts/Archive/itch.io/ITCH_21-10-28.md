# ExterminAtion

**Dear Friends,**
we got a lot of ground to cover in this one.
So without further ado, let's jump straight into it.

This one's pretty self explanatory, so I won't dwell on it.
But don't worry! I've got something even better for you!

Remember the **release stream** we were planning to do for Act 2?
Well, plans changed and we delayed it until the** release of the final Ac**t.
Of course, that's still more than two weeks away. 
But since the game is now more or less done, anyway, we might as well do it **this weekend**.

Full schedule:
**Saturday, the 30th October (20:00-00:00 CEST)
Sunday, the 31st October (10:00-13:30 & 16:30-20:00 CEST) **
We're still discussing some formalities regarding the stream.
But the first segment will definitely be handled by the person I've already mentioned many times, before.
Yup, it's ya boy [Nyaro~](https://www.twitch.tv/nyaro)!
Please follow and subscribe <3.
As for the content, we'll cover **everything from the** **ProAgon to Act 3**.
In other words,  everyone will get a chance to see it.  And if you want, you can be part of that, too.

Either through the stream, or for yourself.

Normally, I wouldn't do this.

But since it's going to be streamed, anyway, I might as well just **upload the build to itch**.
Keep in mind this will be a** functional, albeit very buggy** build.
So if you don't mind being patient, there's no harm in waiting for the **proper release on November 13th**.

If you do want to give this a shot, you're more than welcome.
In addition, I would highly appreciate if you could **reach out and tell me about any whoopsies** you encountered.

In any case, I'm gonna go back to work and try to get the most out of the two days I have left.

I'll try do another short post on Saturday a few hours before the stream kicks off.
Until then, I hope you have a few amazing days.
See you on Saturday, my lovelies.
Much love, hugs et cetera
Nory
