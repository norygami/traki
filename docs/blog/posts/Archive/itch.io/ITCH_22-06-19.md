# AUTONOMY

## Christmas has come early
![](https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzkyMzYxOTcucG5n/original/vUVyWC.png)**TRACHI – AUTONOMY 1.5 (arteria) is now live.**
God, that's a mouthful. Luckily, I'll never ever have to say it again.

From today onwards, AUTONOMY will have to fend for itself. As part of the TRACHI universe, of course.

But also as its own product. At any rate, I hope that – for all of its flaws – AUTONOMY will be able to stand the test of time somewhat.

I believe that there's tons of stuff to uncover, and I'm incredibly excited to pick up the many pieces and threads in the following instalments. But for now, I want to use this space to say a huge thank you to everyone who's been part of the journey. One year ago, I had a story on my hands. Today, it's come to its conclusion.

So one more time, with gusto:![](https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzkyMzYyMDkucG5n/original/K8T8VI.png)
To everyone that's reading this. 
And to everyone who isn't.

**I love each and everyone of you.**
But for those of you who love me back, I want to tell you something. Because you being here means that you care. So let's – for a moment – imagine that we're the only two people on the world. Because – frankly – that's all it takes.

TRACHI is derived from the word **trachea**, aka windpipe. Trachea on the other hand is an ellipsis of **trachea arteria**, aka the rough artery. In itself, **arteria** originally referred to the windpipe, as well. In other words both terms denote the same thing.

**The windpipe**, which we use to breathe. Most times, it's just that. Inhalation as a means to stay alive. Followed by breathing out.

There is, however, a way to utilise this process. By modifying a few muscles, we turn a waste disposal process into something beautiful. We turn air into words. And while certain things are better left unsaid, there is a time and place for everything.

Or an entire world, for that matter.

A world a bit like our own. But also very different, obviously. Just like breathing in eventually leads to breathing out, seeing things makes us think about them. And in that manner, we put our own spin on it.

For as long as I could think, I wanted to make something. And for better or worse, that's the reason why this project exists. The reason why I uploaded the first version of TRACHI in August 2019.

Almost two years later, on June 20th, 1.0 was released. And for the first time, I was proud. So proud, in fact, that I accepted it as a part of myself. And introduced it to a couple of friends. At that point, everything changed.

Because I could no longer keep two identities. I had to take responsibility. So for 6 months, I pooled everything I had into this project. Because I wanted it to be good. And because my name was on the line.

I didn't want TRACHI to be another cute & quirky indie game that people experienced just because they wanted to do someone a favour. To be honest, I am a very petty and vain person. The individual games are products, of course. But TRACHI in itself, to me, is ideology. Or a philosophy, if you're feeling pretentious.

It is a way to look at the world. Because in truth, everything is perspective. And whether we exhale air to dispose waste or turn them into words doesn't really matter that much. At least not in the greater context of things.

Our planet will keep on spinning, and our sun will keep on burning. Regardless of whether TRACHI exists or not. However, that, too, doesn't really matter. Because to us, the important thing is that we're here. And for as long as our lives go on, we want to leave something behind.

It's the least we can do. Not for anybody else. But for ourselves. It's what we are. And who we like to be. 

That – in my opinion – is the only thing that really matters.

So please, make yourself at home, if you want. No matter what you might or might not think of it. This place is yours as much as it's mine. In here, you are welcome, accepted and embraced. Because at the heart of it, everyone of us wants the same thing.

# Just like this city – we want to be free.

**Thank you, once again.**
### Farewell arteria.
## Farewell RPGMaker.
# Goodbye, AUTONOMY.
