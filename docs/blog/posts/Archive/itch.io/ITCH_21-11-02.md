# You can see it, too.

**Aloha, everyone.
**
This weekend, two major things happened.
# TRACHI 1.35 (5597)
![](/assets/blog/images/itch/2021/ARhWJ3.png)
For one, the** Alpha of TRACHI 1.4** was **released**.
In other words, the** f****ull story** is now available to play.
There's few pieces (such as random NPC dialogue) and a few other small things missing, still. But apart from that, it's all there. Everything from the prologue, to the epilogue. 
I will do a proper preview next weekend, so I'll leave it at that, here.

Because there's something else I want to talk about.

# A glance, a chance, a group.

Normally, I do the promo non-gamey stuff at the beginning. It's much easier for me to write that down in a couple of sentences, before I dive into more cerebral things.
But this time, I want to give it the spotlight. This weekend, I learned something very important:
How good it feels to be wrong.

# I am a sceptic

And when in doubt, I doubt. After the difficulties in scheduling before the first take in September, I was mega anxious. The window of opportunity was incredibly short, and I wasn't sure if people were as invested, anymore.
But it happened. **We streamed the entire thing.**

And boy it was absolutely amazing! I'm still basking in the after-glow and struggle a bit with finding the right words to express it.
So I'll just post the links to the **VODs**, instead:
[**ProAgon (InvitAtion) **& **Act 1 (InfiltrAtion)**](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1192323664)**
[Act 2 (InfestAtion)](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1192806203)
[Act 3 (InsubordinAtion)](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1192325842)**
Please do yourself a favour and check it out. **
Really, I mean it.**

# A love letter
This weekend was among the most fun I ever had. And I am super glad that I got to spend it with you.

**Areh, Aster, Cali, Dudii, Hibari, Jase, Jerome, Soren, Ve.**
Thank you for making an entire city come alive.Â  And a dream come true for me.

A big shout out also to [Jase](https://www.twitch.tv/nyaro) and [Jerome](https://www.twitch.tv/jayseeffaye) for streaming it. You had a lot of clicking to do, and sometimes a bit back-seating to endure. And in spite of that, you lead us through this weekend gallantly. I couldn't have done it half as good as you.

Last but not least, I want to express a heartfelt thank you to three artists whose music I used, excessively.
Thank you, [Echo Blue](https://www.echobluemusic.com/), [LucasGitanoFamily](https://www.youtube.com/c/LucasGitanoFamily) and Claude Reid for graciously allowing me and others to use their tracks.
**TRACHI wouldn't be half as groovy without you.**
With all that being said, I think that's everything taken care of.
If you're interested to see more of TRACHI - Well, the Alpha is out.

I'll try to upload a Beta this weekend. And with it, the last devlog before the release of 1.4.
Hurray!

Have a nice week, everyone!
