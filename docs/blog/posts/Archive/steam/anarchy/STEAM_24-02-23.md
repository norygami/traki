# Merci (Beta)

### **Heyho, friendly People! 👓**

Next Wednesday, we're saying **thank you** everyone! Our first big milestone is a celebration of ANARCHY's biggest strengths. Among other things, ***Merci*** builds a bridge between ParAdise and the rest of the TRACHI world, adds our first new-world indoor areas and three new main story quests. 

Most importantly: you can play through all of that right now! The pre-build just landed on the **public beta branch**. An overview of the new features can be found in the [**preview**](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2169000/view/4061752935703119910?l=english) – in addition to the preliminary **changelog** below. If you run into any issues, feel free to **leave a message** in this [**thread**](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2169000/view/3890611710969491203?l=english).

Massive thanks to [**RacoonButler**](https://normalhumanboy.carrd.co/) for this incredible scenery! It's part of a composition we've been teasing in this month's [**preview**](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2169000/view/4061752935703119910?l=english). Next Thursday, the full thing will be unveiled, as we kick off ANARCHY's second phase. In the meantime, we'll do our best to make it worth your while! 🥰

Best wishes, many hugs and – if we're feeling brave – a shy bunch of kissies on the cheek.

**much love**
