# Renaissance (Beta)

## Heyho Friends & Family!
As promised – here's the ANARCHY 0.2.2 (*Renaissance*) beta. 

The flagship addition is the first part of a new chapter – **ExtrapolAtion**. If you'd like to know what it's about, allow me to gently point you to the [Preview](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2169000/view/4188989134099863984) from a couple of weeks ago.

There's also a new combat mechanic: **Counter**. It's born out of a larger rework – covered in this [technical post](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2169000/view/4151835070979945097). That announcement also mentioned an overhaul of **Variations**. There's a high chance we'll take a dedicated look at the *what*, *how* and *why* for that as well.

On the whole, *Renaissance* is feature-complete. What's left is to test ANARCHY itself and apply the proper polish. If there's time, I'll try to work in more flavour and prep the stage for ExtrapolAtion B. 

I'll save that and the bigger picture for the actual release on **June 28th**. Until then, I wish you a spectacular week – with high hopes to talk to you again very soon. 🥰

**much love**
