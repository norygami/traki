# ExtrapolAtion (Beta)

## Hey Friends! 👋

**Holy moly – is it time!** Four months after the fact, I'm proud (and relieved) to finally present the next stage of ANARCHY. 

We're talking two new chapters, manipulation mechanics, ultimate abilities, reworked stats, conversation control, interaction menus (Talk / Trade / Examine) and streamlined (auto)-save functionalities. Furthermore, we hammered out the Act structure:

## Big Picture

The missing pieces (formerly ExtrapolAtion B & C) complete the **prologue** – which now directly leads to ParAdise. You can start a (true) new game in ExcommunicAtion or jump into any chapter / phase between that and Lorna waking up next to a monolith.

Starting now, you get to enjoy the first five movements of a new major questline (*Eremite*), grab twelve new challenges from the hunting board and / or talk and trade with NPC patrols. If you're a dreamer with a taste for future tense, I'm sure you'll appreciate the first glimpse at a new central hub.

## Frontier

All of that is accompanied by new **combat mechanics**: from path-AOEs to manipulation abilities, from Weapons that turn into combatants, to a completely new stat (XTC) that unlocks character-specific ultimates. By the way: Did I mention there's 6 new characters, 12 new / adjusted pieces of BGM and a skip, auto and (henceforth persistent) dialogue log?

Honestly, there's so many changes to cover. I didn't even get to tell you about the achievements, variations and the like. You know what? **Here's a thought**: Give the Beta a spin and let me know what you think. We could hold hands while we put the belts and braces on that thing! 😊

## Feedback

Going forth, you can access the form through a permanent button on the top-right of your screen. Once you hit submit, your thoughts are bundled together with a screenshot and a player log – and dispatched directly to me.

As for everything else: We'll save the proper overview for the release on the live branch (sometime before christmas). For now, please enjoy the beta for an update that is nothing short of a metamorphosis. ANARCHY just took a big step towards becoming the game it wants to be.

I'll see you in a week or two! 🙏

**much love**
