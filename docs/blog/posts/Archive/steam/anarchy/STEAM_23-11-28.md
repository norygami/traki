# Marche

### Heyho friends! üëã

Today is the **28th November**. In other words: **ANARCHY 0.1.3 is live**! The update itself has been covered in this week's [**devlog**](https://youtu.be/JTvhVw2-er4?si=gXn7779WpH460_g_), but we'll also have a proper **look** at the most important **features** right here.

### **En avant! üê±‚Äçüë§**

As mentioned in the [**preview**](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2169000/view/3749869144024608259), ***Marche*** aims to shake things up. It is all about **movements** involving **characters**, **enemies** and **you**.

In addition to a completely **new Fragment** and another **quest segment** for ParAdise, there's big improvements to **ExcommunicAtion's dialogue**, more **abilities**, patrolling **Battle Triggers**, **interaction prompts** ‚Äì and last but not least ‚Äì vastly improved **camera systems**. 

### **A long time AGO**
![](/assets/blog/images/steam/2023/766defd0d36e4dad29b4e585cd6944a2148aea82.png)
**Ten years** before the events of [**AUTONOMY**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1811440/TRACHI__AUTONOMY/), **two sisters** from the countryside moved into a **city**. Not just any city, though! We're talking about the **capital** of a continental great power known as **Ionia**. The city, going by the name of **Aion**, is home to almost a **million people**. You'd think it's comparatively easy to **disappear** in a city like that ‚Äì if you can keep your mouth shut.

### **FAR away from home**
![](/assets/blog/images/steam/2023/4e6c45f57bb172b0b223a90150430cf0fa4b69d7.png)
Unfortunately for everybody involved, **Lorna** isn't good at **keeping secrets**. It takes a whopping two lines of **dialogue** for her to blurt out **something** she shouldn't have. Her older sister, **Ekaterina**, is understandably concerned. 

She and her most trusted confidante ‚Äì **Cleopatra Antioka** ‚Äì moved mountains so the **three of them** could live a steady, quiet and seemingly **comfortable life**. Of course, there's **bigger things** at play. But it's at least a bit of **slice-of-life** before it all comes **crashing** down.

### **ExCommunity**
![](/assets/blog/images/steam/2023/0e8359dda9bfca8015ecd947b6eb925a6ffde942.png)
If you ever wanted to **step** behind the **curtain**, you're not alone! Throughout **TRACHI's history**, there have been numerous attempts by **people** to see **their world** for what it really is. **ExcommunicAtion** marks the most daring **adventure** of that kind. 

As the characters begin to **understand** the gravity of their **circumstance**, it's only fair that you should be in on it, too! To better reflect that, the **dialogue** has been **polished** comprehensively ‚Äì including a couple of **rewrites** here and there.

### **Identity**
![](/assets/blog/images/steam/2023/b6b6ba2d294d3951525d1e8ee9755d076b52780f.png)
Speaking of rewrites: There's a whole **new chapter** to the main story **quest**. In **ParAdise**, there's people. And when there's **people**, there's **rules**. Not everybody can go **everywhere** ‚Äì at least not without **giving** something in return. Sometimes you have to pay a little **toll**, fill out a couple of **forms** ‚Äì and sometimes you have to provide **proof** of who you are. Thankfully, **Lorna** has a **service card**. At least she used to have it, somewhere.

### **Atlantis**
![](/assets/blog/images/steam/2023/00e5394f9ecf36136caa074896cb328fd35eb2b0.png)
Between **1918** and **1919**, there was a series of similar incidents. **Lorna** lost her **service card**, and so she asked **someone** for **help**. Fortunately for her, she had the right kind of **questions** for someone who **knows** a lot of things. Even though **he** himself might not always have all the **answers**, he's very good at pointing in the right **direction**. Hopefully, he can help her in this case, too.

### **InterAction**
![](/assets/blog/images/steam/2023/e91e06c9f8faa2f65559701dbbe270de4fe76fac.png)
Just like Atlas helps Lorna, I'd like to help **you** learn more about the **world**as well. There's approximately five to ten **new interactions**, ranging from triggering **Fragments** to making dog go *woof*. üê∂

Previous iterations of the **Interaction HUD** only provided you with context-insensitive **information**. Going forward, **interactions** will be further classified into the categories *Read*, *Open*, *Talk* and *Examine*. Some of these also already state the **object** you're about to **interact** with ‚Äì aka individual **Fragments** and/or **NPCs**.

### **Catalyst**

</div>

Depending on your situation, you might not want to **interact** with **everything**. However, you don't always have a choice. **Battles** in **ParAdise** ‚Äì for example ‚Äì trigger upon **collision** with a ***Field Impostor***. The battles themselves are a lot more **varied** with 0.1.3, bumping up the amount of regular field **encounters** to a total number of **ten**.

As for the **impostors**: most of them remain **static**, but one of them has learned to **move**. It's a big step towards creating a **dynamic world** with enemies that **patrol**, **flee** ‚Äì or even **chase**.

### **Manipulation**
![](/assets/blog/images/steam/2023/a557188f90a67ee1fff71efdc7eb9df15ea04177.gif)
If you happen to trigger a **battle**, you'll find that you now have an extended range of **tools** at your disposal. A new ability named ***Knockback*** allows you to push an **enemy** back by one **tile** ‚Äì or alternatively bump it into another enemy to cause **150% damage** to both **entities**.

This particular **ability** marks the introduction to a **set** that hopefully at some point constitutes a full **arsenal**. The goal is both for your **enemies** and you to exert **control** not only over your own respective **crews**, but your **targets** as well.

### **MOVement**
![](/assets/blog/images/steam/2023/ce4db1bbfd275ee7b09e2ecdfdd4684f5b0bf5d2.png)
In regards to general **status values**, the **movement range** of combatants acting on a **battle grid** has been streamlined into an overarching stat called ***MOV***. Each point of this **value** enables you to **traverse** the grid by one **tile**.

Next to already existing **(de)buffs** such as ***Slow*** or ***MonoFast()***, certain **equipment** pieces also **modify** this particular value. One of these is **Ganymede**'s pistol ***First Response***, another example would be an **accessory** going by the name ***IONIA***.

### **Viewport**

</div>

Barring the occasional line of **dialogue**, the player (**you**) is mainly represented through the actions of the **characters**. But there is another, much more prevalent **element** connecting you to the world of **TRACHI**. Something that neither you nor the character's directly **perceive**. But whenever there's **you**, **it** is also there.

The **camera** is the primary **component** responsible for helping you keep track of **things**, and it's only right that you should in all cases get a proper **view**. To this end the **camera system** has been fully **reworked**, especially in regards to **battle** segments.

### **CRASHI**
![](/assets/blog/images/steam/2023/e678010b4928e68dea8e266013a5f24f0b27e08d.png)
Around 2 1/2 weeks ago, a friend approached me with **reports** of regular **crashes** occurring in **ANARCHY**. Unfortunately, I couldn't reproduce them on my end, so me and my good Friend [**Sereon**](https://www.twitch.tv/sereon) spent between 10-15 hours trying to **isolate** the issue. 

In the midst of **troubleshooting** we also came across some **inconsistencies** regarding **achievements**. Most importantly, ***Broken Wings*** didn't fire correctly. We've applied a couple of **fixes** regarding the achievements and also managed to make the **crashes** disappear. If you should run into **any issues** regardless, please **get in touch with me**. üòä
 
### **Cotext**
![](/assets/blog/images/steam/2023/6bc5c2f62266f91f02885a4cd77faa41fdf0f630.png)
***Marche*** was a first attempt to tie a patch together **thematically**. It was born out of necessity due to extraordinary **day-job commitments** forcing me into isolated **development** sprints. For all intents and purposes, it was the first time since **February** that I felt even remotely **disconnected** from **TRACHI**.

Given these **circumstances**, I'm incredibly relieved that **0.1.3** turned out so well. However, **cuts** had to be made somewhere. Contrary to what was announced in the [**preview**](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2169000/view/3749869144024608259), ***Marche*** will **not** feature a new **achievement**. Instead, we'll **extend** 0.1.2's **challenge** to 0.1.3 and ship both the **upcoming challenge** and the **corresponding Variation** with **0.1.4** on **December 28th**.

### **Conclusion**
![](/assets/blog/images/steam/2023/d0101c9bc85bc25d713a3c379b3645b8bedaf046.png)
The previous **month** might not have been all **sunshine** and **roses**. However, ***Marche*** still doesn't shy away from a comparison with its **predecessors**. Having to put a bigger focus on **content** rather than **infrastructure** not only made me **appreciate** the fruits of the **work** done through **September** and **October**, but it also predesignated the primary **goal** for **December**.

As a little teaser, let me reveal to you the **major system** I want to work on for **0.1.4 (Variet√©)**. As the **tagline** suggests, I'll finally sit down and extend the existing **character Variations** to a full system incorporating **Steam Inventory Items** as a means to **customise** your party's **visual appearances** using a dedicated slot in the ingame **Equipment menu**.

### **Outlook**
![](/assets/blog/images/steam/2023/67cd59adc0a7069562a37374910efaa07aadc3c3.png)
Hopefully, **Variations** will not only constitute one of **ANARCHY's** biggest **features**, but also serve as an **incentive** to participate in early-access **playtesting** ‚Äì and last but not least: open up ways of **monetisation** so I can work on **TRACHI** while also keeping every other element of it **100% free**.

Either way, I'll be back in **two weeks** with a little **sitrep** including a preview of **Variet√©**. Until then, please enjoy **ANARCHY 0.1.3** and all its **additions** to your heart's content. And of course, feel yourself **hugged** and **appreciated** for your gracious and **irreplaceable support**! üòä

Big hugs and kissies! ü•∞

**much love**  
nory
