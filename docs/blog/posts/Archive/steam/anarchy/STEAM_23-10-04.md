# Encore (Preview)

### Greetings, friends! üòä

We're about **halfway** on the road towards **ANARCHY's second update**. There's **a lot** to unpack already, and I can't wait to present it all to you! So without further ado ‚Äì

## Point 1.2
![](/assets/blog/images/steam/2023/bb82f5c27ebd0c14be5be9492096c40e60fec5ad.png)
**0.1.1** (*Trois*) put a big focus on **infrastructure**. Largely thanks to that, we can now shift gears steadily towards rolling out **new content**. Highlights include a rework of **ExcommunicAtion's Phase 4**, big improvements to **ParAdise's starting area** and ‚Äì last but not least ‚Äì the first couple of **InvAsion scenes**.

## Home again.

Revisiting these brought back tons of **memories**. **InvAsion** was my first **Unity** project, and it shows! There's big post-autonomy "sky is the limit" vibes ‚Äì both in terms of **content** and **infrastructure**.

Going in, I tried to get rough **idea** of how much work **(re)implementing** these scenes would be. So I started by **reworking** the scenes' **basic setup**. In other words: It might get a bit technical now. üò≥

## Then.
![](/assets/blog/images/steam/2023/b91f959c05353337a502f382ca17e22fe03b0335.png)
**InvAsion** was originally built around an RPG Kit called **ORK Framework**. Halfway during development, I ported all the **conversations** into a dedicated **Dialogue System**. In the end, ORK was completely cut from the final build, since InvAsion was mostly comprised of conversations.

## Now.
![](/assets/blog/images/steam/2023/6426ffcabdd27216a240efaacc9e5a5f7cc8d09e.png)
**ANARCHY** on the other hand heavily uses the **RPG elements**. So the overarching infrastructural goal here was to embed **InvAsion's (Dialogue System) conversations** into **ORK**. For the most part, you won't notice a difference ‚Äì barring new **UI elements** and a couple of other details.

## Fast to Past
![](/assets/blog/images/steam/2023/811135bdfc515e269001d3004c64b4f7de3a425c.png)
The actual **dialogue** has mostly been **left intact**. Thirteen months later, the lines still hit the same. And the **acoustic BGM** is a great change of pace compared to the **J-Rock** tracks you're encountering for example during **ExcommunicAtion**. 

All in all, these scenes are big **nostalgia** trip, and they're a perfect fit for a game centered around **(re)discovering yourself**.

## The Point
![](/assets/blog/images/steam/2023/f9cd49ca95d689734e63fb293c0e074fb1813b78.png)
During the events of **ParAdise and on**, characters rediscover their **memories** by reliving key moments of their **original lives** ‚Äì i.e InvAsion et al. Completing these **"Fragments"** will not only offer additional **exposition**, but also directly affect the characters by unlocking **status bonuses**, **abilities**, **equipment** and so on.

## Memories
![](/assets/blog/images/steam/2023/3a859441e4d6a19b1187f19c68ba70efa2fc1dcc.png)
Essential memories will be directly tied to the **main story quest**. Naturally, there's also plans for a lot of **optional sequences** that you can discover either through completing **side-quests**, stumbling upon **Mementos** or interacting with **other characters**. 

This should make a great incentive to go out and **explore**, especially due to the fact that it ‚Äì in most cases ‚Äì improves the **characters** capabilities, too.

## Economy

Speaking of **interactions**: A **familiar face** has set up a little **shop** in ParAdise. Just like her mythological namesake, our very own **Ariadne** is ‚Äì once again ‚Äì here to help you out. At the moment, she offers a small selection of **items** and **equipment**, with a potential to unlock more goodies down the road.

## ParAdise
![](/assets/blog/images/steam/2023/90c95d51020e8ec836532eed52cd3c1fce6a0be7.png)
Overall, **ParAdise's first map** has received a lot of love. It's an ongoing process, and will likely take a couple of months until the map itself is somewhat presentable. But I'm getting more and more comfortable working with the **new tiles**. 

During AUTONOMY, I made a lot of **maps** simply because making them **felt good**, and I'm already starting to get that exact feeling again.

## What's left
![](/assets/blog/images/steam/2023/2d9d0c466ccb43e9df0e33ee7fa0089fa7f11dbe.png)
I mentioned a rework of **ExcommunicAtion's Phase 4**. It's planned to happen this weekend, so there's not much to show yet. But here's what I'm **planning** to do: Both Icarus and Ariadne will get a **unique ability** each. 

**Icarus** will have an **aura** that transfers a portion of damage dealt to **Ganymede** onto himself. **Ariadne** on the other hand will get a **big AoE** that takes an entire turn just to build up. Any **damage** inflicted to her in the meantime will **cancel** the cast. In other words: It falls to **Daphne** (and you) to give **Ariadne** the time she needs.

## Branching out
![](/assets/blog/images/steam/2023/feb5b944e2b2107e9206295a85321fea14473bc0.png)
If you'd like to preview any of these changes for yourself, you can now switch between the **live** and **beta** branch. In most cases, both your **settings** and **progression** should be **fully compatible**. If not, please be so kind and get in touch with me. üòô

## To conclude
As you can see, **0.1.2** packs quite a punch. I'm super satisfied with the current pace, especially since around **2/3 of the changes** are already in. In accordance to what I said above, I'll try to get the **ExcommunicAtion** bits set up during the next couple of days.

Afterwards, I'd like to reimplement another **InvAsion scene**. I'd love to tell you all about it! Luckiliy for the two of us ‚Äì there's no need! A very **talented and special [friend](https://twitter.com/houndsjaw)** put it far better than I ever could:

![](/assets/blog/images/steam/2023/243ab8448399ee29dd01da7d25bf9ceadda57d18.png)
I hope **you** and **everyone you love** have a great couple of days! ‚ù§
Soon enough, we'll talk more about 0.1.2.

Until then ‚Äì as always ‚Äì **big, big hugs** to you! ü§ó

**much love**  
nory
