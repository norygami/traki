## Hey friendos!

We're cruising with increasing excitement towards **August 28th**.

Four years ago, **[TRACHI â€“ AUTONOMY](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1811440/TRACHI__AUTONOMY/)** was released to the public for the very first time. In other words:

### TRACHI's birthday is coming up! ðŸ¥³
 If you've been reading [the previous post](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2169000/view/6741373241922724912?l=english), you're already aware of last year's event. If not, don't worry! Because I'm here to provide exactly that kind of **context** to you.

### Remember 2022?![](../../../../../assets/blog/images/steam/2023/414c44cedc2f90ff8b935170eabf5cc6015eb3df.png) I certainly do! I also recall that TRACHI got another game to its name. A cute little **interactive novel**, widely known and feared as **InvAsion**. Primed and ready to bring AUTONOMY vibes from RPGMaker straight to Unity.

### Rules of narrative![](../../../../../assets/blog/images/steam/2023/8fe60c994ea362718402019be95f242fd1108392.png)
**InvAsion** embraced **AUTONOMY's** biggest selling point and slammed all its figurative eggs into the **story** basket. For about three quarters of an hour, the **characters and their words** got to carry us through increasingly disturbing events.

### Structurally![](../../../../../assets/blog/images/steam/2023/da8dd135ae506f994c1f8b08b59aa0615eca792e.jpg)
I wanted to apply a similar scope to this year's 2808. To deliver a **short and straight-forward experience** presenting the current **state of development**. And of course â€“ add a whole new page to the TRACHI saga.

### New frontiers![](../../../../../assets/blog/images/steam/2023/41a056838a27a68efa8c5256f328256aa77a7ab7.png)
If you've been following the [ANARCHY devlogs](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA2lQHRVfM3ad227SUAKALMUJXTbPVcmB), you're probably aware that the game itself strives to marry **RPG driven combat with dialogue-driven storytelling**. After close to **four months of development**, I think it's high-time you got to experience the first fruits of that.

### 2023![](../../../../../assets/blog/images/steam/2023/bd27e3ae048f76971ca8702c1a8a64fb6905d79a.png)
Next Monday, **[TRACHI â€“ ANARCHY](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2169000/TRACHI__ANARCHY/)** enters **early access**on Steam. The initial release (0.1) not only features the majority of the **game's eventual infrastructure**, but alsoâ€“ most importantly â€“ the game's full introduction.

### ExcommunicAtion![](../../../../../assets/blog/images/steam/2023/16547a47e2ce6f0caab75107b8d1e10793a566ab.png)
Coming your way is a **multi stage battle** that condenses ANARCHY's current combat elements into a single encounter. A **10-20 minute dance** between **two characters** you of all people should be more than familiar with. So it probably won't come as a huge surprise when I tell you that there's a bit of a story there.

### I won't dwell on it![](../../../../../assets/blog/images/steam/2023/56ed33610c2487215a6bcbd1037560ef43908130.png)
But I want to tell you one thing: For a the last six months or so, I've worked on building a bridge. In **AUTONOMY**, I presented an **early 20th century micro cosmos**. In ANARCHY, the world might look different, **but the people are still the same**.

### Hop, skip and a jump![](../../../../../assets/blog/images/steam/2023/96629d4d8c2554962190aeb60f616d0e1522d1cc.png)
If you can, think of ANARCHY as an **odyssey**. A journey through foreign space, viewed through a memory called *home*. Most â€“ if not all â€“ events are **reconfigured representations of in-world historical events**. Supplemented by an entire arsenal of old-world scenes of course.

### Speaking of..![](../../../../../assets/blog/images/steam/2023/2549de0201ccb25a00155063bdc68877c424b27a.png)
Similar to AUTONOMY, **historical exposition** in ANARCHY also heavily relies on **flashbacks**. You might recognize some of these scenes, because **InvAsion** itself will also eventually be completely integrated into **ANARCHY**.

### In other words![](../../../../../assets/blog/images/steam/2023/3fb29277e70712b0b39d7e428cec6a6220110ce3.png)
We'll be looking much closer at each of these **people**. We'll help them rediscover their **memories**, both through the present and the past. One way or another, **the story of TRACHI goes on**. And at the end of it, hopefully both we and the characters understand ourselves and each other a bit better.

### To conclude
As always, I want to thank you very much for reading this. The "artist" in me hates to admit it. But **I wouldn't be doing this, if it wasn't for you**.

### Two days from now
The clock strikes ANARCHY. Going forward, it's your story as much as it's mine. Because of that, and many many other reasons, I can only encourage you to share whatever impressions, concerns and wishes you have.

For the next 3 years, **I'll be right here**. Making the best version of TRACHI â€“ **together with you**! ðŸ˜Š

Until then and beyond â€“ with **deep admiration from your most passionate fan** â€“
