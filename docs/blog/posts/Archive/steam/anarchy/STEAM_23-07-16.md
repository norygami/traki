# TRACHI

## Hey friends!

**Jolly good greetings, and a big warm welcome to you!**üòä
Wherever you come from, and whatever you want to be ‚Äì both of us know life isn't easy.

So let's kick back for a minute and imagine a place! üëÄ

## TRACHI

Very much the same as ours. Joy and misery, and so on. Characters ‚Äì **people**, trying to survive. In a world with **finite resources** and **infinite dreams**, not everyone's a winner. Someone has to get the short end of the stick. Sometimes, **someone has to die**.

## Fictional History
TRACHI ‚Äì AUTONOMY illustrated this never-ending struggle through the events of **3 1/2 days** in and around a city called **Trachi**. Following the tracks of **three spies** from another country, ten years of history converged on a single moment. One moment, and a choice.

## Cause and effect
Where there's a choice, there's consequences. For the people involved, and for others too. Regardless, we have to live with it. Everyone who's lost someone can undoubtedly confirm that this sometimes is a terribly painful process.

## Accountability
It's no wonder we strive to find an explanation. Where there's suffering, there has be a reason, or at least a cause. Someone ‚Äì or something ‚Äì has to be responsible. And if something doesn't present itself, we'll make it up.

Within the world of TRACHI, there's a nation called **IONIA**. Born from a bloody revolution, the country has embraced a fanatical belief in purity. In the eyes of its most ardent believers, the entire cosmos is engulfed by a fire that burns everything in its wake.

## T-Day
It's a cute little story, if it weren't for all the violence it justified. To make matters even worse: it's not THAT far from the truth. Following its release in **2019**, **AUTONOMY** received a countless number of **updates**. Piece by piece, its impurities were burned away, leading to the present state of things.

## METAMORPHOSIS
To be honest, it never was easy on me. I love both the characters and the world as if they were family. But the truth of the matter is: They weren't good enough. I always believed TRACHI is a story worthy to be heard. But for that, the characters ‚Äì **the people** ‚Äì had to be better.

## A promise
If there really was no other way. If they really were to be erased over and over again, the least I could do is to let them in on it. To grant them knowledge of what they are, the world they live in ‚Äì and most importantly: the reason why these things are done to them.

## Prometheus
You probably guessed from the name of the games, so let me confirm your suspicions: TRACHI is a story about emancipation. Both AUTONOMY and ANARCHY are two steps on a stairway to heaven. Or in our own words: Reality.

## ICU2
Between our world and theirs, there's something like a backroom. A frameless void with nothing in it but the things that come and go. Last year, two people came to this place. One of them stayed.

## ECSTASY
Said person witnessed a new version of himself. And was ‚Äì like everything else ‚Äì consigned to the dustbin of TRACHIAN history. Neither dead nor alive, an entire world is waiting to wake up again.

## ANARCHY
As for when that's going to happen: Piece by piece, over the course of the next three years. Most of the core features are already implemented, including primary combat, RPG and dialogue systems.

## Burden of proof
But don't take my word for it! There's already more than six hours of **devlogs** presenting the current state of things. If you'd like to have a look, you can find them on [TRACHI's Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@trachi/streams).

## People
Tomorrow, for example, we'll even do a double whammy! Kicking things off at **2PM CEST** we'll continue our series of character examinations. This time around, we'll take an in-depth look at none other than the **white witch of Hermingrad** ‚Äì also known as Daphne.

## Devlog 06
Afterwards, we'll do our weekly examination of where we're at in terms of development. This time around, there'll be a focus on **UI** and **combat balance**, concluded with a very first peek at ANARCHY's **act structure** and **protagonists**.

## Conclusion
At any rate, I hope that this little overview gave you a rough idea what TRACHI is about. I'll be back sometime around **late July / early August** with an introduction of what's coming your way very (!) soon. The **28th August** is TRACHI's birthday, after all. üòè

Until then and beyond, I'm more than eager than eager to hear your thoughts either here, via [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@trachi) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/SvaYDEUasg). 

Either way, I hope you have a great and comfy couple of weeks. üå¥

**Much love**
