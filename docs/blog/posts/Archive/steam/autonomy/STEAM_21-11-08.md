## **Hey old and new friends!**
Today marks the next step in the timeline of **TRACHI**. Today, its release on **Steam** has been confirmed.

Thus, I welcome you, whether you have or have not seen it, to dive into this world and see what it's all about.

*Alright, have it your way.*

On the **24th November 2021**, you can play this isometric adventure through Steam, as well. I'm still polishing some stuff, but most of the basic features like the in game Overlay and cloud saves have already been implemented.

In any case, I would highly appreciate for as many people as possible to test these functionalities.
As such, please do not hesitate to contact me either through Steam or Discord if you would like to be a beta tester.

And of course, if you do find anything wonky, please let me know.

With that being said, I will keep you updated on any changes.

Until then, I wish you the best of a time and am looking forward to kick this off on Steam, as well.

## Oh, one more thing:

To whoever read this, and we'll hear from each other, again.

**Much love**,
Nory
