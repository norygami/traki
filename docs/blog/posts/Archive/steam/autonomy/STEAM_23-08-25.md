## Hey friendos!

We're cruising with increasing excitement towards **August 28th**.

To celebrate **TRACHI's fourth birthday**, I wanted to present my favorite version of you with a little peck on the cheek. üòè

But before we get into that, let's do a tiny itsy bit of **context**, first!

### Remember 2022?![](/assets/blog/images/steam/2023/414c44cedc2f90ff8b935170eabf5cc6015eb3df.png) I certainly do! I also recall that TRACHI got another game to its name. A cute little **interactive novel**, widely known and feared as **InvAsion**. Primed and ready to bring AUTONOMY vibes from RPGMaker straight to Unity.

### Rules of narrative![](/assets/blog/images/steam/2023/8fe60c994ea362718402019be95f242fd1108392.png)
**InvAsion** embraced **AUTONOMY's** biggest selling point and slammed all its figurative eggs into the **story** basket. For about three quarters of an hour, the **characters and their words** got to carry us through increasingly disturbing events.

### Structurally![](/assets/blog/images/steam/2023/da8dd135ae506f994c1f8b08b59aa0615eca792e.jpg)
I wanted to apply a similar scope to this year's celebration. To deliver a **short and straight-forward experience** presenting the current **state of development**. And of course ‚Äì add a whole new page to the TRACHI saga.

### New frontiers![](/assets/blog/images/steam/2023/41a056838a27a68efa8c5256f328256aa77a7ab7.png)
If you've been following the [ANARCHY devlogs](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA2lQHRVfM3ad227SUAKALMUJXTbPVcmB), you're probably aware that the game itself strives to marry **RPG driven combat with dialogue-driven storytelling**. After close to **four months of development**, I think it's high-time you got to experience the first fruits of that.

### 2023![](/assets/blog/images/steam/2023/bd27e3ae048f76971ca8702c1a8a64fb6905d79a.png)
Next Monday, **[TRACHI ‚Äì ANARCHY](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2169000/TRACHI__ANARCHY/)** enters **early access**on Steam. The initial release (0.1) not only features the majority of the **game's eventual infrastructure**, but also‚Äì most importantly ‚Äì the game's introduction.

### ExcommunicAtion![](/assets/blog/images/steam/2023/16547a47e2ce6f0caab75107b8d1e10793a566ab.png)
Coming your way is a **multi stage battle** that condenses ANARCHY's current combat elements into a single encounter. A **10-20 minute dance** between **two characters** you of all people should be more than familiar with. So it probably won't come as a huge surprise when I tell you that there's a bit of a story there.

### I won't dwell on it![](/assets/blog/images/steam/2023/56ed33610c2487215a6bcbd1037560ef43908130.png)
But I want to tell you one thing: For a the last six months or so, I've worked on building a bridge. In **AUTONOMY**, I presented an **early 20th century micro cosmos**. In ANARCHY, the world might look different, **but the people are still the same**.

### Hop, skip and a jump![](/assets/blog/images/steam/2023/96629d4d8c2554962190aeb60f616d0e1522d1cc.png)
If you can, think of ANARCHY as an **odyssey**. A journey through foreign space, viewed through a memory called *home*. Most ‚Äì if not all ‚Äì events are **reconfigured representations of in-world historical events**. Supplemented by an entire arsenal of old-world scenes of course.

### Speaking of..![](/assets/blog/images/steam/2023/2549de0201ccb25a00155063bdc68877c424b27a.png)
Similar to AUTONOMY, **historical exposition** in ANARCHY also heavily relies on **flashbacks**. You'll probably recognize some of these scenes, because **InvAsion** itself will also eventually be completely integrated into **ANARCHY**.

### In other words![](/assets/blog/images/steam/2023/3fb29277e70712b0b39d7e428cec6a6220110ce3.png)
We'll be looking much closer at each of these **people**. We'll help them rediscover their **memories**, both through the present and the past. One way or another, **the story of TRACHI goes on**. And at the end of it, hopefully both we and the characters understand ourselves and each other a bit better.

### To conclude
I want to thank you very much for reading this. The "artist" in me hates to admit it. But **I wouldn't be doing this, if it wasn't for you**. 

Three days from now, the clock strikes ANARCHY. I hope to see **as many of you as possible** over there. Contrary to the characters, you can be in two places at once. Really, you should try it! I'm doing it all the time. 

Almost four years later. And I'm still all over the place. ü•¥

Until next time, honey boos! ü§ó

**much love**
