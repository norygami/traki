The **Endo-Kathartic Dialect** is the domestic branch of [Ionian Intelligence Service][]. 

## Foundation
Born from a loose assembly of locally organized veterans, EnKAD emerged as a result of the first **Congress to combat liberal and socialist terrorism** in 1905. Although EnKAD established a reputation for violence, the government's inability to deal with wide-spread strikes gradually shifted the perception towards EnKAD's brutal but ultimately effective interventions. When EnKAD was formalized as the paramilitary wing of the newly-formed ION, the former gained further legitimacy as protectors of locally-elected officials. 

## Smyrna
This shift in public opinion – bolstered by rising unemployment and inflation – saw a detachment of several hundred Dialects greeted by roaring cheers as they marched into Smyrna. The leader of the Anatolian section – known under his mononym *Crius* - proudly declared the city as 

!!! quote "Aion ionia – A Nation against Time"

    *The core, the heart, the center of humanity.*

Although the Hellenian government and several dozen other states condemned the occupation of a city formally under international administration, no it took several months to formulate a physical response. By that time, EnKAD had not only marched on Smyrna – but also on Athens, Thessaloniki Nikomeda and Byzantion. Through a mixture of campaigning, lobbying and intimidation, the ION achieved 38% in the 1910 elections.

    Ekklesia, Majority, Dichotomy

When EnKAD was reorganized into a branch of the [Ionian Intelligence Service][] in 1921, EnKAD fielded several thousand agents and operated all across Ionia.

Due to the secretive nature of the organization, the majority of their operations are classified. However, EnKAD is rumored to have played a major role in the reintegration of Kenovice and the quelling of the Hippocrats in 1915. The latter was led by a former EnKAD official named [Crius][], who had risen to the position of deputy to the Chairman before the restructuring of the Committee forced both of them out in 1914.

In addition, the former General Secretary, [Teron Pravoskos][], also rose through the ranks of EnKAD to become Secretary of State Security in 1914, shortly after the incident at Fredrick Dam.

Even though EnKAD has been officially integrated into the IIS and thus ceased to exist as a political entity, its command structures are supposedly still in place and a significant portion of former agents remained active in their former capacity.
