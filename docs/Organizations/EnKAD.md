The Endo-Kathartic Division served as the official secret police of the [People's Union of Ionia](../States/Ionia.md). From its inception in 1908 to being consolidated into the [Ionian Intelligence Secretariat](../Organizations/IIS.md) in 1921, EnKAD fielded several thousand agents and operated all across Ionia.

Due to the secretive nature of the organization, the majority of their operations are classified. However, EnKAD is rumored to have played a major role in the reintegration of [KenoviÄ‡](../Cities/Kenovice.md) and the quelling of the [Hippocrats](../Organizations/Hippocrats) in 1915. The latter was led by a former EnKAD official named [Crius](../People/Crius.md), who had risen to the position of deputy to the Chairman before the restructuring of the Committee forced both of them out in 1914.

In addition, the former General Secretary, [Terence Prawnfield](../People/Hyperion.md), also rose through the ranks of EnKAD to become [Secretary of State Security](../Organizations/StateSec) in 1916, shortly after the incident at [Fredrick Dam](../Events/Fredrick_Dam).

Even though EnKAD has been officially integrated into the IIS and thus ceased to exist as a political entity, its command structures are supposedly still in place and a significant portion of former agents remained active in their former capacity.
