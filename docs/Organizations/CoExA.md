The Commissariat for External Affairs was the intelligence section of the Secretariat for Foreign Affairs. 

From its inception in 1912 to its consolidation into the [Ionian Intelligence Service][] in 1921, operatives of CoExA were active all over the world, with a dedicated focus on the continents of Europa, Asia and Afrika. As Ionia's primary foreign intelligence agency, CoExAs dedicated goals lay in the subversion of foreign political structures through a wide range of measures.

As such, CoExA supposedly played a crucial role both in the reclamation of Kenovice and the incident at Fredrick Dam. Due to the decentralized nature of the Commissariat, it is however unclear how many operatives were and are still active, even as a part of the IIS. The only publicly known measure of CoExA is found in operation effigy. Even though the operation was formally conducted by the IIS, a series of documents leaked by a senior officer confirm that it was solely comprised of former CoExA agents without any involvement by former EnKAD operatives.

The failure of operation effigy not only served to severely hamper the reputation of CoExA as an organization, but also led to serious questions being posed towards its former leadership in the person of Ioanis Fero. As such, it is fair to assume that this incident led to a severe shift of power within the IIS to the disadvantage of CoExA.
